It's my journey as Quality Assurance Tester

### About me
  Hi, My name is Vendy M. Putra. Since late 2018 I have been learning and practising become a QA. Starting from my hobby of playing Game and works at Gameloft as a Game tester, I started to get interested and developed profound passion in testing. I am happy to have finally found an area in which I love to do and it gives me a hope and confidence to succeed in this field. My journey has been marked by continuous learning through courses, self-study, and hands-on experience, which has deepened my understanding of software quality. 
  In todayâ€™s fast-paced tech industry, QA plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of software products. By identifying bugs and enhancing user experiences, QA contributes significantly to the overall success of technology in society. As software evolves, so too does the complexity of testing, presenting exciting challenges that I eagerly embrace. Being a QA professional means a commitment to lifelong learning, adapting to new methodologies, and staying abreast of industry advancements. I thrive in this dynamic environment, constantly seeking to improve processes and deliver high-quality software.
  In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skills that I have gained so far. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also started learning test automation, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge and practise in this area.
